<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>




<h1>We equip you to support those in need and gain tools to walk the journey yourself</h1>
<p>We introduce you to the basic skills used by counsellors in Basic Skills, and offer a range of workshops, from ‘Counselling Adolescents’ to ‘Children and Bereavement’. We also offer other workshops to bring understanding of the process and how to walk your own journey and walk with those in need. Please check our schedule to see what workshops are currently being offered.</p>
<br>
<h1>Skills. Understanding. Personal growth.</h1>
<p>Hope House is passionate about developing the skills and experience of counsellors in Cape Town.
  We also know the power that workshops can have to equip and grow members of the public,
  so we offer a variety of workshops to the public who would like to join in and learn.
