    <h2><B>WHO WE ARE</B></h2>
    <p>We are setting residents up with an “exit strategy,” says Carrie Casey, manager of community development and housing at New Castle County, which runs the Center. We believe that students are humans first and that their basic needs are central conditions for learning. The purpose of Hope Center Ministries is to provide men and women with the opportunity to overcome their drug and alcohol addiction through their faith.</p>
